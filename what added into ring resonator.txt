1. first changed lda0 to lda1 in all parameter, because lda0 exist from before
1.1 first added analytics1(w), analytics 2 (eta), analytics 3 (R)
2. then added, (ewt), perfect magnetic conductor 1, at side boundary [pg 10]
3. then added, (ewt0, scattering boundary condition [pg 10]

4. then, Wave Equation, Electric 1, [pg 11]
5*. then added mesh, instead of boundaries 1,3, chosen the boundaries as port 1 and port 2
6. follow the pdf same upto, page 12

7*. then added, time domain for study, i.e step 4 time dependent
8. instead of solution 1, since it exist, created solution 2 (ewt)
